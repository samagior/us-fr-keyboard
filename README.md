# us-fr-keyboard

Simple "United State Internationnal" (US-INTL) keyboard layout with the dead key removed from the APOSTROPHE and QUOTATION MARK allowing direct access; same as the standard English "United State" keyboard layout.
 
This keyboard layout was made using the *[Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator (MSKLC)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=102134)* from the standard US-INTL keyboard layout as a template. 

It is made for people who use a ponctuated language and APOSTROPHE/QUOTATION MARK on a regular basis for who runing multiple layout isn't a viable option.

It is listed as FR (french) because it wasn't tested with any other language yet. Any other language that doesn't relies on those two key for regular ponctuation should work just fine.

For exemple, in french using this layout ; 
1. é/ç ; are regularly used ponctuation **Easely Accessible from the AltGr Key**.
2. ë/ï/ü ; are hardly accessible but **Uncommon Ponctuation** *(not recommanded if you need those ponctuation on a regular basis)*
