# us-fr-keyboard

The US-FR layout is a revised version of the US-INTL layout (United States - Internationnal) with the dead keys removed from the APOSTROPHE and QUOTATION MARK.
 
It was made using the [Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator (MSKLC)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=102134).

## Explanation

This layout is for people using a 50/50 blend of french and english for who runing multiple layout isn't a viable option. Any other ponctuated language that do not relies on APOSTROPHE and QUOTATION MARK for regular ponctuation may work just as fine (only tested with french).

For exemple, in french using this layout ; 

- é/ç ; are ponctuation made using the APOSTROPHE key. Since they are made **easely accessible** already from the AltGr modifier; we can easely accomodate for the missing dead key.
- ë/ï/ü ; are ponctuation made using the QUOTATION MARK key. Since they are **uncommon ponctuation in french**, we can normaly live with the missing dead key.
- Both dead key are moved further on the key; level 3 (AltGr) and 4 (AltGr+Shift) if ever they are needed.
