# us-fr-keyboard

Simple "United State Internationnal" (US-INTL) keyboard layout whit the dead key removed from the APOSTROPHE and QUOTATION MARK allowing direct access to them; same as the standard English "United State" keyboard layout.
 
This keyboard layout was made using the *[Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator (MSKLC)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=102134)* from the standard US-INTL keyboard layout as a template. This revised layout is meant for people who use a ponctuated language on a regular basis and also want an easy access to the APOSTROPHE and QUOTATION MARK; same way as the standard US layout. 

It is listed as FR (french) because it wasn't tested with another language yet. Any other language that doesn't relies on those two key for regular ponctuation should work just as fine.

For exemple, in french using this layout ; 
1. é/ç ; are regularly used ponctuation **Easely Accessible from the AltGr Key**.
2. ë/ï/ü ; are hardly accessible but **Uncommon Ponctuation** *(not recommanded if you need those ponctuation on a regular basis)*
