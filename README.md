# us-fr-layout

 French version of the United States-International keyboard.

 This layout is exactly the same as the standard US-INTL keyboard with the ACUTE ACCENT and DIASERESIS dead key being pushed further to their right-full place; AltGr groups of the same VK_OEM_7 key; allowing direct access to the APOSTROPHE and QUOTATION MARK.

 French specific accent being far less extensive; needed ACUTE letters are already accessible through AltGr keys and DIASERESIS being less commonly used; we can normally deal with it being further on the key.

 Be aware; DIASERESIS letter may require some good hand gymnastic to reach depending on your keyboard layout (7u space bar keyboard for instance).

## Modifications

1. VK_OEM_7 key :
    - gr1 = APOSTROPHE dead key to make ACUTE ACCENT letters changed for a regular APOSTROPHE.
    - gr2 = QUOTATION MARK dead key to make DIAERESIS letters changed for a regular QUOTATION MARK.
    - gr3 = Regular ACUTE ACCENT changed for an ACUTE ACCENT dead key to make ACUTE letters.
    - gr4 = Regular DIAERESIS changed for a DIASERESIS dead key to make DIASERESIS letters.
