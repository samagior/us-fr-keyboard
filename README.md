# us-fr-keyboard

The US-FR layout is a revised version of the US-INTL layout (United States - Internationnal) with the dead keys removed from the APOSTROPHE and QUOTATION MARK.
 
It was made using the [Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator (MSKLC)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=102134).

The US-FR layout is appropriate for people who use th french language or any other ponctuated language that do not relies on APOSTROPHE and QUOTATION MARK for it's main or regular ponctuation. It is not the best for english, and not the best for french, but if your workflow make it unviable to run multiple layout and you like the standard US layout; then this layout may be the right fit for you.

It is listed as FR (french) because it wasn't tested with any other language yet. Any other language that doesn't relies on those two key for regular ponctuation should work just fine.

For exemple, in french using this layout ; 

- é/ç ; are ponctuation made using the APOSTROPHE key. Since they are made **easely accessible** already from the AltGr modifier; we can easely accomodate for the missing dead key.
- ë/ï/ü ; are ponctuation made using the QUOTATION MARK key. Since they are **uncommon ponctuation in french**, we can normaly live with the missing dead key.
- Both dead key are moved further on the key; level 3 (AltGr) and 4 (AltGr+Shift) if ever they are needed.
