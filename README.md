# us-fr-klc

 French version of the United States-International standard keyboard layout, created with the free Keyboard Layout Creator (KLC) application from Microsoft.

 This layout is for anyone who is french typing on a standard US keyboard. (use case 47.5% french, 47.5% english, 5% anything else)

## Layout modifications

- On VK_OEM_7 key :
    1. dead key replace on APOSTROPHE from ACUTE ACCENT to GRAVE ACCENT; the only often required APOSTROPHE ACCENT are for e and c letters which already have the AltGR option directly on the associated key, ACUTE ACCENT reasigned for international letters (see below).
    2. dead key removed on QUOTATION MARK; DIAERESIS rarely used in comparision to QUOTATION MARK, DIAERESIS reasinged (see below).
    3. dead key ACUTE ACCENT added on 3rd key (AltGR option) for international letters or secondary alternative to AltGR keys (é and ç).
    4. dead key DIAERESIS added on 4th key (AltGr + Shift option).
